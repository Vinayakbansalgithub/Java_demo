//Data Hiding means protecting the members of a class from an illegal or unauthorized access.
//Thus we can say Encapsulation automatically achieve the concept of data hiding providing security
//to data by making the variable as private and expose the property to access the private data which would be public.
//
//
//Key Differences Between Data Hiding and Encapsulation
//
//Encapsulation deals with hiding the complexity of a program. On the other hand, 
//data hiding deals with the security of data in a program.
//
//Encapsulation focuses on wrapping (encapsulating) the complex data in order to present a simpler view
//for the user. On the other hand, data hiding focuses on restricting the use of data, intending to assure the data security.
//
//In encapsulation data can be public or private but, in data hiding, data must be private only.
//
//
//Data hiding is a process as well as a technique whereas, encapsulation is subprocess in data hiding.


//Conclusion
//I conclude by saying that data hiding and encapsulation both go hand in hand where data hiding focuses on the security of data,
//the encapsulation focuses on reducing the complexity of the system in order to make the application more user-friendly.
