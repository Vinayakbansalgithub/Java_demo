//he Facade Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. 
//It is like when we turn on our smartphone, we just push one button and we ignore all the operations that have to be done behind.
//
//The goal of the Facade Pattern is to reduce coupling and complexity. However,
//a Facade doesnâ€™t forbid us to access to the subsystem. We can also have multiple Facades for one subsystem.
//
//Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.
//
//Create facades to define entry points to each level of a subsystem. You can reduce coupling between multiple subsystems by requiring them to communicate only through facades.
