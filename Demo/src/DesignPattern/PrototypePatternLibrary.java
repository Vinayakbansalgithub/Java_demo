//The Prototype pattern is generally used when we have an instance of the class (prototype) and 
//we'd like to create new objects by just copying the prototype.
//
//Let's use an analogy to better understand this pattern.
//
//In some games, we want trees or buildings in the background.
//We may realize that we don't have to create new trees or buildings and render them on the screen every time the character moves.
//
//So, we create an instance of the tree first. 
//Then we can create as many trees as we want from this instance (prototype) and update their positions. 
//We may also choose to change the color of the trees for a new level in the game.
//
//
//
//This pattern is handy when our new object is only slightly different from our existing one
