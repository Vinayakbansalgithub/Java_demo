//The implementation of bridge design pattern follows the notion to prefer Composition over inheritance.

//Advantages
//Allows independent development of the componentsâ€™ features
//Promotes the introduction of layers into a system
//Provides a good solution for cross-platform development.
//
//
//The Bridge design pattern separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently from each other.
//In this case, the abstraction uses another abstraction as its implementation instead of using the implementation directly
//
//
//example we dont have a Nokia wirless charging phone 
//Nokia phone + wireless is a featured added , not tightly coupled
//
//
//
//Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction(Assistance) and implementation elements(nokia,vivo) of a class by
//creating two separate class hierarchies to change independently,
//whereas an Adapter pattern helps two incompatible classes to work together.
//
//
//
//abstraction:The abstraction we started off with. (Charger)
//Refined Abstraction:This extends the original abstraction and has more features than the original abstraction. (Wired)
//Implementor:This is the interface that defines the interface for the implementation classes. (phone)
//ConcreteImplementor:This is the class that implements the Implementor interface and knows how to instantiate the abstraction. (nokia)
//
//
//Use the Bridge pattern when you want to divide and organize a monolithic class that has several variants of some functionality
//
//Use the pattern when you need to extend a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions.
//
//Use the Bridge if you need to be able to switch implementations at runtime.
//
//
//Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new abstractions and implementations independently from each other.
//Single Responsibility Principle. You can focus on high-level logic in the abstraction and on platform details in the implementation.
